                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>I was born and raised in the beautiful county of Kirinyaga, Kenya. Growing up in this agricultural region taught me the value of hard work, community, and connection to the land.</p>

                                <h3>Primary School Days (2006-2014)</h3>
                                <p>Attended local primary school where I discovered my love for mathematics and problem-solving. My teacher noticed my analytical skills and encouraged me to participate in science fairs.</p>

                                <h3>High School Discovery (2015-2018)</h3>
                                <p>Joined computer club in high school where I had my first real exposure to technology. We had only five computers for the whole school, which taught me patience and sharing resources.</p>

                                <h3>Formative Experience (2018)</h3>
                                <p>My uncle visited from Nairobi with a laptop and showed me how to create a simple webpage. That moment sparked my interest in software development and changed my career direction.</p>

                        <h3>Family Influence</h3>
                        <p>My parents, both educators in our community, instilled in me the importance of education and continuous learning. My father taught mathematics at the local high school, and his logical approach to problem-solving influenced my thinking. My mother, a primary school teacher, taught me patience and the value of explaining complex ideas in simple terms.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sunday afternoons were family time - we would discuss current events, solve puzzles together, or play board games. These sessions sharpened my analytical thinking and taught me how to approach challenges from different perspectives.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Community Impact</h3>
                        <p>Growing up in a close-knit community taught me the value of collaboration. During harvest seasons, neighbors would come together to help each other. This sense of communal support inspired my interest in creating technology solutions that bring people together and solve shared problems.</p>
